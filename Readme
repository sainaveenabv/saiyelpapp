1 Overview
This repository contains the source code for

Creating a two-page application using the Yelp Fusion API.

On the first page, you should be able to search for businesses in Naperville. When you select a result, it should take you to a second page where you can see details about the business.

2. Setup Instructions
   The application uses real data by leveraging the Yelp Fusion API.

3.Cors
This app uses the CORS Anywhere because the Yelp Fusion REST API is meant for server to server communication and does not support CORS So proxy all request through CORS Anywhere so we can focus on building the frontend part of the application.
